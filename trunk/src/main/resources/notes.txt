    * They may have embedded [xbrls:calculationGroup] items within in.
      * Which will have [xbrli:item] items, the cells themselves.

  * Rows are [Element] objects, where the cells are [Datapoints].


Hierarchy (Accounts)
---------

* Any [xbrldt:dimensionItem] items are not directly rendered.

* A [xbrls:lineItemsGroup] is table (with one column).
  * If the next value is [xbrls:hierarchyGroup], we're putting in paragraphs of text.

      * Don't render types:BasisOfReportingItemType types directly.
        * xbrls:textItemType may be embedded within each other.

    * This will have multiple [xbrli:item] items, the cells themselves.

------

* Any [xbrldt:dimensionItem] items are not directly rendered.

* A [xbrls:lineItemsGroup] is a table.
  * Rows in the table may be grouped together by [xbrls:recordGroup] items.
    * The immediate children of these will be [xbrli:item] items, which constitute columns.
       * The children of the columns with be [xbrli:item] items, the cells themselves.
    * Row labels are defined in the [xbrldt:dimensionItem] axes.

  * Columns are [Element] objects, where the cells are [Datapoints].
